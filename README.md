As an intern, I have worked on several projects involving python and Machine Learning: 
1.	Predicted scores of a dataset of 50 students with respect to number of hours studied using machine learning and linear regression
2.	Predicted the Optimum Number of Clusters in a dataset of 150 entries and represented it visually
